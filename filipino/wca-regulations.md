### Pagsasalingwika

Tandaan na ang mga pagsasalingwika ay hindi opisyal na bersyon, kahit na ito ay nakasama sa websayt ng WDA para mapakinabangan.
Kung may pagkakaiba sa sinalingwika at sa (kasalukuyang opisyal) bersyong Ingles, ang bersyong Ingles ang dapat gamitin

### Mga Regulasyon at Alituntunin ng WCA

Ang mga Regulasyon ng WCA ay naglalaman ng lahat ng mga Regulasyong ginagamit sa lahat ng opisyal na kompetisyon na pinahihintulutan ng Asosasyon ng World Cube Association. 
Ang mga Regulasyon ng WCA ay dinaragdagan ng [Mga Alituntunin ng WCA](guidelines:top). Ang mga Regulasyon ay dapat ituring na kumpletong dokumento, pero ang mga Alituntunin ay naglalaman lamang ng mga klaripikasyon at paliwanag. 

### Paggamit ng salita
Ang paggamit ng salitang "dapat", "hindi dapat", "pinapayo", "hindi pinapayo" at "maaari" tulad sa [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

        - 9b3a) Round formats for these events are: "Best of X" (where X is 1, 2, or 3).
        - 9b3b) For 3x3x3 Blindfolded, the WCA also recognizes "Mean of 3" rankings and records based on the times from "Best of 3" rounds.
- 9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
    - 9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes are measured and truncated to the nearest hundredth of a second. All timed averages and means under 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second.
    - 9f2) All timed results, averages, and means over 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest second (e.g. x.4 becomes x, x.5 becomes x+1).
    - 9f4) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if the attempt is disqualified or unsolved/unfinished.
    - 9f5) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if the competitor is eligible for an attempt but declines it.
    - 9f6) For "Best of X" rounds, each competitor is allotted X attempts. The best result of these attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f7) For "Best of X" rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.
    - 9f8) For "Average of 5" rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts are removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining 3 attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f9) For "Average of 5" rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor has more than one DNF and/or DNS result in the round, their average result for the round is DNF.
    - 9f10) For "Mean of 3" rounds, competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The arithmetic mean of the 3 attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.
    - 9f11) For "Mean of 3" rounds, if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS result, their average result for the round is DNF.
    - 9f12) For "Best of X" rounds, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor. The following are used to compare results:
        - 9f12a) For timed results, "better" is defined as the shorter time.
        - 9f12b) For Fewest Moves Solving, "better" is defined as the shorter solution length.
        - 9f12c) For Multiple Blindfolded Solving, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, or if only 1 puzzle is solved, the attempt is considered unsolved (DNF). If competitors achieve the same result, rankings are assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors failed to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles are better.
    - 9f13) For "Mean of 3" and "Average of 5" rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where "better" is the smaller recorded result.
    - 9f14) For "Mean of 3" and "Average of 5" rounds, if two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best attempt per competitor, where "better" is defined as the smaller recorded result.
    - 9f15) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive an identical ranking for the round.
- 9g) A Combined Round consists of two phases of attempts, where competitors advance to the second phase if they meet a designated cutoff during the first phase.
    - 9g2) Whether a competitor proceeds to next phase of a Combined round must be decided by the result (all competitors with a better result than x) of the first phase (see [Regulation 9f12](regulations:regulation:9f12)).
- 9i) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings.
    - 9i1) The WCA recognizes the following types of regional records: national records, continental records, and world records.
    - 9i2) All the results of a round are considered to take place on the last calendar date of the round. If a regional record is broken multiple times on the same calendar date, only the best result is recognized as breaking that regional record.
    - 9i3) If the WCA Regulations for an event are changed, existing regional records stand until they are broken under the new WCA Regulations.
- 9j) Each event must be held at most once per competition.
- 9k) All competitors may participate in all events of a competition, except in cases specifically approved by the Board.
- 9l) Each round must be completed before any following round of the same event can start.
- 9m) Events must have at most four rounds.
    - 9m1) Rounds with 99 or fewer competitors must have at most two subsequent rounds.
    - 9m2) Rounds with 15 or fewer competitors must have at most one subsequent round.
    - 9m3) Rounds with 7 or fewer competitors must not have subsequent rounds.
- 9o) Combined rounds count as one round when counting the number of rounds per event.
- 9p) If an event has multiple rounds, then:
    - 9p1) At least 25% of competitors must be eliminated between consecutive rounds of the same event.
    - 9p2) The competitors who advance to the next round must be determined by ranking (best x competitors) or by result (all competitors with a better result than x) in the preceding round.
        - 9p2a) For each round, advancement conditions must be announced before the round starts, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.
    - 9p3) If a qualifying competitor withdraws from a round, they may be replaced by the best-ranked non-qualifying competitor from the preceding round.
- 9s) Each round of each event must have a time limit (see [Regulation A1a](regulations:regulation:A1a)).


## <article-10><solved-state><solvedstate> Article 10: Solved State

- 10b) Only the resting state of the puzzle, after the timer has been stopped, is considered.
- 10c) The puzzle may be in any orientation at the end of the attempt.
- 10d) All parts of a puzzle must be physically attached to the puzzle and fully placed in their required positions. Exception: see [Regulation 5b5](regulations:regulation:5b5).
- 10e) A puzzle is solved when all colored parts are reassembled and all parts are aligned within the limits specified below:
    - 10e1) For every two adjacent parts (e.g. two parallel, adjacent slices of a cube) of the puzzle that are misaligned by more than the limit described in [Regulation 10f](regulations:regulation:10f), the puzzle is considered to require one additional move to solve (see "Outer Block Turn Metric" in [Article 12](regulations:article:12)).
    - 10e2) If no further moves are required to bring the puzzle to its solved state, the puzzle is considered solved without penalty.
    - 10e3) If one move is required, the puzzle is be considered solved with a time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - 10e4) If more than one move is required, the puzzle is considered unsolved (DNF).
- 10f) Limits of acceptable misalignment for puzzles:
    - 10f1) NxNxN puzzles: at most 45 degrees.
    - 10f2) Megaminx: at most 36 degrees.
    - 10f3) Pyraminx and Skewb: at most 60 degrees.
    - 10f4) Square-1: at most 45 degrees (U/D) or 90 degrees (/).

    - 10h1) The solved state of Clock is achieved when all eighteen inner clock faces point to 12 o'clock.


## <article-11><incidents><incidents> Article 11: Incidents

- 11a) Incidents include:
    - 11a1) Incorrect execution of event procedures, by officials or competitors.
    - 11a2) Interference or facility interruptions (e.g. power failure, emergency alarm activation).
    - 11a3) Equipment malfunction.
- 11b) If an incident occurs, the WCA Delegate determines an impartial and appropriate course of action.
- 11d) If the WCA Regulations are not fully clear or if the incident is not covered by the WCA Regulations, then the WCA Delegate must make a decision based on fair sportsmanship (also see [Regulation 11e3](regulations:regulation:11e3)).
- 11e) If an incident occurs during an attempt, the WCA Delegate may grant a competitor an extra attempt, replacing the attempt during which the incident occurred. The competitor must appeal verbally or in writing to the judge and WCA Delegate at the time of the incident, before finishing the original attempt, to be eligible for an extra attempt. An appeal does not guarantee the competitor an extra attempt.
    - 11e1) If a competitor is granted an extra attempt, the extra attempt must be scrambled using a different scramble sequence. This scramble sequence must be generated using a current official version of an official WCA scramble program (see [Regulation 4f](regulations:regulation:4f)).
    - 11e2) If a competitor is granted an extra attempt, the extra attempt should be done right after the attempt that caused it, and must replace the original regularly numbered attempt.
    - 11e3) If it is unclear whether an incident should result in an extra attempt, the competitor may be granted a provisional extra attempt that will be used only if it is later found that an extra attempt was appropriate (e.g. by a decision of the WRC).
- 11f) Decisions about an incident may be supported with video or photographic analysis, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.

## <article-A><speedsolving><speedsolving> Article A: Speed Solving

- A1) Speed Solving attempts must abide by the following procedures.
    - A1a) The organization team must enforce time limits for solves and/or rounds.
        - A1a1) The default time limit per solve is 10 minutes, though the organization team may announce a higher or lower time limit.
        - A1a2) Cumulative time limits may be enforced (e.g. 3 solves with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes - see [Regulation A1a5](regulations:regulation:A1a5)). The time elapsed in a DNF result counts towards the cumulative time limit.
        - A1a3) For each round, any time limits must be announced before the round starts, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.
        - A1a4) The competitor must end each solve within the time limit. If a competitor reaches the time limit for a solve/round, the judge stops the solve immediately and records the result as DNF. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see [Regulation H1b1](regulations:regulation:H1b1)).
        - A1a5) A solve is considered to meet the time limit if and only if the final result, after any time penalties are applied, is less than the time limit. Exception: Multiple Blindfolded Solving (see [Regulation H1b1](regulations:regulation:H1b1)).
    - A1b) If the time limit for a solve is greater than 10 minutes, a stopwatch must be used for timekeeping.
        - A1b1) A Stackmat must be used in addition to the stopwatch. Exception: for events without inspection where the competitor is expected to exceed 10 minutes, use of the Stackmat is optional.
        - A1b2) If a time from the Stackmat timer is available, it is the original recorded time. Otherwise, the stopwatch time is the original recorded time.
    - A1c) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements (e.g. know how to solve the puzzle). A competitor must not compete with the expectation of a DNF result or an intentionally poor result. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF)  or disqualification from the event (see [Regulation 2j](regulations:regulation:2j)), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- A2) Scrambling:
    - A2a) When called for a round, the competitor submits a puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler. The competitor then waits in the Competitors Area until they are called to compete.
    - A2b) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in [Article 4](regulations:article:4).
        - A2b1) For Square-1, the organization team may enforce placing a thin object in the puzzle to prevent accidental moves from being applied before the start of the attempt. If these objects are used, this must be announced before the round starts.
    - A2c) After the scrambler starts scrambling the puzzle, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the inspection phase starts.
        - A2c1) The scrambler places a cover over the scrambled puzzle that makes it impossible for any competitors or spectators to see any part of the puzzle. The cover remains over the puzzle until the start of the attempt.
    - A2d) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge briefly inspects the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of the puzzle. The judge raises any concerns with the scrambler, who then conducts a detailed check.
        - A2d1) The organization team may require scramblers to take additional measures to make sure that they have applied the correct scramble sequence (e.g. signing the score sheet to affirm that they applied the correctly-numbered scramble sequence and checked that it matches the image, or using an additional person as "scramble checker").
    - A2e) The judge places the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation while ensuring that it remains completely covered.
        - A2e1) The competitor is not permitted to request a specific orientation, and the judge must not influence the orientation they place the puzzle on the mat based on what they know or expect the puzzle state to be.
- A3) Inspection:
    - A3a) The competitor may inspect the puzzle at the start of each attempt.
        - A3a1) The competitor is allotted a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle and start the solve.
    - A3b) The judge prepares the timer by turning it on and resetting if necessary. Separately, the judge also prepares a stopwatch for timing inspection.
        - A3b1) When the judge believes the competitor is ready, the judge asks "READY?". The competitor must be ready to start the attempt within one minute of being called, or else the competitor forfeits the attempt (DNS), at the discretion of the judge.
        - A3b2) The competitor starts the attempt by confirming that they are ready, and the judge uncovers the puzzle and starts timing the inspection.
    - A3c) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during inspection.
        - A3c1) The competitor must not apply moves during inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
        - A3c2) If the parts of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may align the faces, as long as misalignments stay within the limits of [Regulation 10f](regulations:regulation:10f).
        - A3c3) The competitor may reset the timer before the start of the solve.
        - A3c4) For Square-1, if the use of a thin object inside the puzzle has been enforced by the organization team (see [Regulation A2b1](regulations:regulation:A2b1)), the competitor may remove the object from the puzzle during inspection.
    - A3d) At the end of the inspection, the competitor places the puzzle on the mat, in any orientation. Penalty for placing it outside the mat: time penalty (+2 seconds).
        - A3d2) When 8 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls "8 SECONDS".
        - A3d3) When 12 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls "12 SECONDS".
- A4) Starting the solve:
    - A4b) The competitor uses their fingers to touch the elevated sensor surfaces of the timer. The competitor's palms must be facing down, and located on the side of the timer that is closer to the competitor. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
        - A4b1) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle between the inspection period and the start of the solve. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - A4d) If a Stackmat timer is in use, the competitor starts the solve by confirming that the timer light is green and then removing their hands from the timer (thus starting the timer).
        - A4d1) The competitor must start the solve within 15 seconds of the start of the inspection. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
        - A4d2) The competitor must start the solve within 17 seconds of the start of the inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
        - A4d3) If a stopwatch is in use, the judge starts the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.
    - A4e) Time penalties for starting the solve are cumulative.
- A5) During the solve:
    - A5a) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not communicate with anyone other than the judge or the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - A5b) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not receive assistance from anyone or any object other than the surface (also see [Regulation 2i](regulations:regulation:2i)). Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
- A6) Stopping the solve:
    - A6a) The competitor stops the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer. If a stopwatch is in use, the judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.
        - A6a1) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor ends the solve by releasing the puzzle and notifying the judge that they have stopped the solve. The judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.
        - A6a2) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor's default notification signal consists of releasing the puzzle(s) from their hands and placing their hands on the surface, with palms down. The competitor and the judge may agree on another appropriate notification before the start of the attempt.
    - A6b) The competitor is responsible for stopping the Stackmat timer correctly.
        - A6b1) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and the timer shows a time strictly below 0.06 seconds, then the attempt is replaced by an extra attempt. A competitor forfeits the right to the additional attempt if the WCA Delegate determines that the timer was stopped deliberately.
        - A6b2) If the timer stops before the end of the solve and displays a time of 0.06 seconds or higher, then the attempt is disqualified (DNF). Exception: if the competitor can demonstrate that the timer malfunctioned, they may receive an extra attempt, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
    - A6c) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the timer. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If no moves have been applied after stopping the timer and before releasing the puzzle, a time penalty (+2 seconds) may be assigned instead, at the discretion of the judge.
    - A6d) The competitor must stop the timer using both hands, placed flat on the sensors with palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
    - A6e) After releasing the puzzle, the competitor must not touch or move the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If no moves have been applied, a time penalty (+2 seconds) may be assigned instead, at the discretion of the judge.
    - A6f) The competitor must not reset the timer until the judge has recorded the result on the score sheet. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the judge.
        - A6f1) If the competitor resets the timer before the result has been completely recorded, the judge must not write down the result from memory or from video or photographic evidence, and must disqualify the attempt instead (DNF).
    - A6g) The judge determines whether the puzzle is solved. They must not make moves or align faces when examining the puzzle. Exception: For Clock, the judge will usually need to pick up the puzzle to verify both faces.
    - A6h) In case of a dispute, moves or alignments must not be applied to the puzzle before the dispute is resolved.
    - A6i) Time penalties for stopping the solve are cumulative.
- A7) Recording results:
    - A7a) The judge tells the competitor the result.
        - A7a1) If the judge finds that the puzzle is solved, they call "OKAY".
        - A7a2) If the judge assigns any penalties, they call "PENALTY".
        - A7a3) If the result is DNF, the judge calls "DNF".
    - A7b) The judge records the result on a score sheet and signs next to the result to acknowledge that the result is correct, complete, properly formatted, and clearly readable.
        - A7b1) If penalties are assigned, the judge records the original recorded time displayed on the timer, along with any penalties. The format should be "X + T + Y = F", where X represents the sum of time penalties before/starting the solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer (the "original recorded time"), Y represents a sum of time penalties during/after the solve, and F represents the final result (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65). If X and/or Y is 0, the 0 terms are omitted (e.g. 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).
    - A7c) The competitor must check the recorded result, and sign (or initial) the score sheet to acknowledge that the result is correct, complete, properly formatted, and clearly readable. This finishes the attempt.
        - A7c1) If the competitor or the judge refuses to accept and sign the score sheet, the WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute.
        - A7c2) If the competitor signs (or otherwise marks) an attempt before they have begun it, they forfeit the attempt and the result will be considered DNS.
        - A7c3) If the competitor signs (or otherwise marks) an attempt after starting the attempt but before the judge has finished recording the result, the attempt will be considered unfinished (DNF).
        - A7c4) The competitor should not sign an attempt before the judge has recorded and signed the attempt. The competitor is ultimately responsible for ensuring that they and the judge have signed an attempt. If an attempt is found to be missing one or both signatures after the judge delivered the score sheet to the score taker (see [Regulation A7f](regulations:regulation:A7f)), it will be considered unfinished (DNF).
    - A7f) When a competitor's score sheet for a round is complete, the judge delivers the score sheet to the score taker.
    - A7g) At the discretion of the WCA Delegate, an incident or penalty caused by a new competitor's inexperience may be replaced with an extra attempt.

    - B4a) The competitor dons the blindfold to start the blindfolded phase.
    - B4b) The competitor must not apply moves to the puzzle before they have fully donned the blindfold. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - B4c) The judge must ensure that there is an opaque object between the competitor's face and the puzzle while the competitor is solving.
        - B4c1) In all cases, the competitor must wear the blindfold such that their view of the puzzle would still clearly be blocked if the opaque object were not in the way.
        - B4c2) By default, the judge should place the object (e.g. a sheet of paper or cardboard) between the competitor and the puzzle while the competitor is wearing the blindfold.
        - B4c3) If the judge and competitor agree beforehand, the competitor may choose to place the puzzle behind a suitable object (e.g. a music stand, the surface of the table) by themselves during the blindfolded phase.
    - B4d) The competitor must not look at the puzzle at any point during the blindfolded phase. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - B4e) Until the competitor applies the first move to the puzzle, they may remove the blindfold to return to the memorization phase.
- B5) Stopping the solve:
    - B5a) When using the Stackmat timer, the competitor stops the solve by releasing the puzzle and then stopping the timer.
    - B5b) When using a stopwatch, the competitor stops the solve by placing the puzzle back onto the surface and notifying the judge that they are stopping the solve. At that moment, the judge stops the timer.
    - B5c) If the competitor is not touching the puzzle, they may remove the blindfold before they stop the timer. They must not touch the puzzle until the end of the attempt. Penalty for touching the puzzle: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).

## <article-E><fewest-moves><fewestmovessolving> Article E: Fewest Moves Solving

- E2) Procedure for Fewest Moves Solving:
    - E2a) The judge distributes a scramble sequence to all competitors. The judge then starts the stopwatch and calls "GO".
    - E2b) All competitors have a total time limit of 60 minutes to devise a solution.
        - E2b1) The judge should call "5 MINUTES REMAINING" at 55 minutes, and must call "STOP" at 60 minutes.
    - E2c) At 60 minutes, each competitor must give the judge a legibly written solution with the competitor's name, using the notation defined for Outer Block Turn Metric (described in [Regulation 12a](regulations:regulation:12a)). Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
    - E2d) The length of the solution is calculated in Outer Block Turn Metric (see [Regulation 12a](regulations:regulation:12a)).
        - E2d1) The competitor is permitted a maximum solution length of 80 (moves and rotations).
    - E2e) The competitor's solution must not be directly derived from any part of the scramble sequence. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
        - E2e1) The WCA Delegate may ask the competitor to explain the purpose of each move in their solution, irrespective of scrambling algorithm. If the competitor cannot give a valid explanation, the attempt is disqualified (DNF).
- E3) The competitor may use the following objects during the attempt. Penalty for using unauthorized objects: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
